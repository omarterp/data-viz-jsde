<h1>CitiBike NYC Info</h1>


<h3>::: Overview :::</h3>

<p>
  CitiBike data consists of summarized data from the years of 2013 through 2016.  The data was obtained from Google
  Big Query.  A data set was created an a storage bucket was created to sink the data.  From there the data was
  pulled into R Studio for data preparation.

  The amount of bike stations throughout NYC has more than doubled since 2013.  Starting with nearly 300, there are
  now more than 600 stations, with over 9M rides originating last year.  The hot spot is in and around midtown.  From
  tourists to locals, commuting to and fro from work.  Ride times increase as you move out from this epicenter.  There
  is also a formidable traffic near Central Park and downtown.  It's a great way to get around town and stay green!
</p>

<h3>::: Data Prep :::</h3>
<p>
  As previously mentioned the data was extracted from a Public data set located in Google Big Query.  Once downloaded
  the data set was prepared with tidyverse, a data preparation and visualization package, in R.  The data includes
  geo-spatial coordinates, therefore a d3 map fun was to be had.  I tracked down a geojson file for NYC and then
  created geojson files for each year of data within R.  Files were then converted to topojson with node and the
  d3 topojson client was leveraged to extract the features.  This is a great capability to store your geo data along
  side with the various properties that can be whatever you'd like.  In this case, summary statistics around the rides
  and bike stations - { station name, total rides, mean trip duration, mean age, last ride year, capacity and mean
  bikes disabled }.
</p>

<h2>~ Scenes ~</h2>

<p>
  Scenes include a cycling through the years of data using sleeps via Promises.  There is an issue with button's borders
  being properly set, though you can see the growth of stations over time.  There are even stations that are removed
  from one year to the next.  See 2015 to 2016 near the legend.  You will see a station drop off.
</p>

<h2>~ Annotations ~</h2>

<p>
  On-demand detail is available from the map giving details around each station.
</p>

<h2>~ Parameters ~</h2>

<p>
  Parameters are the ride years, which are in the form of buttons.  All years summarized and each year is available
  for discovery.
</p>

<h2>~ Triggers ~</h2>

<p>
  The html buttons provide triggers for user interaction to pass in a given year as a parameter to render the stations
  in operation at that time and the various on-demand details.  Zooming is also available to get a closer look at
  the packed density of th stations - quite impressive how many stations there are.  This is a popular service
  no doubt.  I wouldn't dare get on a bike in NYC! =)
